# terraform-iac-explanation.ps1 - Terraform Infrastructure as Code explanation

Write-Output "TERRAFORM: INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE (IaC) EXPLAINED"
Write-Output "=================================================="
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "WHAT IS INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE (IaC)?"
Write-Output "======================================"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing and"
Write-Output "provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable"
Write-Output "definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration"
Write-Output "or interactive configuration tools."
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "TRADITIONAL vs IaC APPROACH:"
Write-Output "=============================="
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "TRADITIONAL (Manual) Infrastructure:"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "❌ Click through Azure Portal manually"
Write-Output "❌ Run individual Azure CLI commands"
Write-Output "❌ Remember exact settings and configurations"
Write-Output "❌ Difficult to recreate identical environments"
Write-Output "❌ No version control for infrastructure changes"
Write-Output "❌ Prone to human errors and inconsistencies"
Write-Output "❌ Hard to track what changed and when"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Example traditional approach:"
Write-Output "az group create --name my-rg --location eastus"
Write-Output "az sql server create --name myserver --resource-group my-rg ..."
Write-Output "az containerapp create --name myapp --resource-group my-rg ..."
Write-Output "# Many manual commands, easy to forget or misconfigure"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE (Terraform) Approach:"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "✅ Define infrastructure in code files (.tf files)"
Write-Output "✅ Version control infrastructure like application code"
Write-Output "✅ Recreate identical environments consistently"
Write-Output "✅ Track all infrastructure changes"
Write-Output "✅ Review infrastructure changes before applying"
Write-Output "✅ Automate infrastructure provisioning"
Write-Output "✅ Self-documenting infrastructure"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "TERRAFORM SPECIFIC BENEFITS:"
Write-Output "=============================="
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "1. DECLARATIVE APPROACH"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "You declare WHAT you want, not HOW to create it"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Example Terraform code:"
Write-Output 'resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {'
Write-Output '  name     = "my-resource-group"'
Write-Output '  location = "East US"'
Write-Output '}'
Write-Output ""
Write-Output 'resource "azurerm_container_app" "api" {'
Write-Output '  name               = "my-api"'
Write-Output '  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name'
Write-Output '  # Terraform figures out HOW to create this'
Write-Output '}'
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "2. STATE MANAGEMENT"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "✅ Terraform tracks current state of infrastructure"
Write-Output "✅ Knows what exists vs what should exist"
Write-Output "✅ Only makes necessary changes (idempotent)"
Write-Output "✅ Can detect drift (manual changes outside Terraform)"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "3. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "✅ Automatically determines resource creation order"
Write-Output "✅ Creates resource group before resources inside it"
Write-Output "✅ Handles complex dependency chains"
Write-Output "✅ Parallel creation when possible for speed"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "4. PLAN BEFORE APPLY"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "✅ 'terraform plan' shows what will be changed"
Write-Output "✅ Review changes before making them"
Write-Output "✅ No surprises - see exactly what happens"
Write-Output "✅ Safe infrastructure changes"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "TERRAFORM WORKFLOW:"
Write-Output "=============================="
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "1. WRITE (Define infrastructure in .tf files)"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "resource \"azurerm_resource_group\" \"main\" {"
Write-Output "  name     = \"my-app-rg\""
Write-Output "  location = \"East US\""
Write-Output "}"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "2. PLAN (Preview changes)"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "terraform plan"
Write-Output "# Shows: + azurerm_resource_group.main will be created"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "3. APPLY (Create infrastructure)"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "terraform apply"
Write-Output "# Creates the actual Azure resources"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "4. MODIFY (Update infrastructure)"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "# Change .tf file, then:"
Write-Output "terraform plan   # See what will change"
Write-Output "terraform apply  # Apply the changes"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "5. DESTROY (Clean up)"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "terraform destroy"
Write-Output "# Removes all managed infrastructure"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "REAL-WORLD USE CASES:"
Write-Output "=============================="
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "1. MULTI-ENVIRONMENT SETUP"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "Same Terraform code creates:"
Write-Output "✅ Development environment"
Write-Output "✅ Staging environment"
Write-Output "✅ Production environment"
Write-Output "✅ All identical except for scaling/naming"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "2. DISASTER RECOVERY"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "✅ Infrastructure destroyed? Run 'terraform apply'"
Write-Output "✅ Entire environment recreated in minutes"
Write-Output "✅ No manual clicking or remembering configurations"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "3. TEAM COLLABORATION"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "✅ Infrastructure changes go through code review"
Write-Output "✅ Everyone sees what's being changed"
Write-Output "✅ Git history shows infrastructure evolution"
Write-Output "✅ No surprise manual changes"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "4. COMPLIANCE & AUDITING"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "✅ All infrastructure changes tracked in Git"
Write-Output "✅ Who changed what and when is recorded"
Write-Output "✅ Easy to enforce security policies in code"
Write-Output "✅ Reproducible compliance across environments"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "TERRAFORM vs OTHER IaC TOOLS:"
Write-Output "=============================="
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "TERRAFORM:"
Write-Output "✅ Multi-cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP, etc.)"
Write-Output "✅ Large ecosystem of providers"
Write-Output "✅ Mature and widely adopted"
Write-Output "✅ Great community and documentation"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "ARM TEMPLATES (Azure native):"
Write-Output "✅ Native Azure integration"
Write-Output "❌ Azure-only"
Write-Output "❌ JSON syntax (verbose)"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "BICEP (Azure's newer IaC):"
Write-Output "✅ Cleaner syntax than ARM"
Write-Output "✅ Native Azure integration"
Write-Output "❌ Azure-only"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "PULUMI:"
Write-Output "✅ Use real programming languages"
Write-Output "✅ Multi-cloud"
Write-Output "❌ Steeper learning curve"
Write-Output ""
