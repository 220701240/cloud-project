Write-Output ""

Write-Output "WHAT IS KUBERNETES?"
Write-Output "==================="
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform"
Write-Output "that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized"
Write-Output "applications across clusters of machines."
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Think of it as a 'smart container manager' that:"
Write-Output "✅ Runs your containers across multiple machines"
Write-Output "✅ Automatically restarts failed containers"
Write-Output "✅ Scales containers up/down based on demand"
Write-Output "✅ Manages networking between containers"
Write-Output "✅ Handles load balancing"
Write-Output "✅ Manages storage and secrets"
Write-Output ""
