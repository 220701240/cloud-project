Write-Output "KEY INTEGRATION POINTS:"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "🔗 API ENDPOINTS YOUR FRONTEND USES:"
Write-Output "   GET  /api/students      → Fetch all students"
Write-Output "   POST /api/students      → Add new student"
Write-Output "   GET  /api/internships   → Fetch internships"
Write-Output "   POST /api/internships   → Add internship"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "🔗 JAVASCRIPT INTEGRATION CODE:"
Write-Output "   File: frontend/student.html (lines 28-42)"
Write-Output "   ```javascript"
Write-Output "   async function loadStudents() {"
Write-Output "     const res = await fetch('/api/students');"
Write-Output "     const students = await res.json();"
Write-Output "     // Display in HTML list"
Write-Output "   }"
Write-Output "   ```"

Write-Output "🔗 BACKEND API HANDLER:"
Write-Output "   File: internship-api/index.js"
Write-Output "   ```javascript"
Write-Output "   app.get('/api/students', async (req, res) => {"
Write-Output "     // Query SQL database"
Write-Output "     // Return JSON response"
Write-Output "   });"

Write-Output ""
Write-Output "✅ REST API DESIGN"
Write-Output "   • Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)"
Write-Output "   • JSON data format"
Write-Output "   • Proper status codes"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "✅ ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION"
Write-Output "   • Non-blocking JavaScript (async/await)"
Write-Output "   • Real-time updates"
Write-Output "   • Error handling"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "✅ CLOUD-NATIVE ARCHITECTURE"
Write-Output "   • Containerized backend (Docker)"

Write-Output "1. 'Let me show you our frontend-backend integration'"
Write-Output "2. Open: https://internship-api.gentleforest-68343e46.centralindia.azurecontainerapps.io/student.html"
Write-Output "3. 'Notice how the student list loads automatically - that's a GET API call'"
Write-Output "4. Press F12, go to Network tab"
Write-Output "5. Refresh page: 'See this GET /api/students call? That's our frontend talking to backend'"
Write-Output "6. Fill the form and add a student"
Write-Output "7. 'Watch this - POST /api/students sends the data to our Node.js API'"
Write-Output "8. 'The API stores it in Azure SQL Database'"
Write-Output "9. 'And immediately updates the list - no page refresh needed!'"
Write-Output "10. 'This is modern full-stack web development in action'"
