Write-Output "TERRAFORM NECESSITY ANALYSIS FOR YOUR PROJECT"
Write-Output "=============================================="
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "CURRENT PROJECT STATUS:"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "✅ Resources already deployed and working"
Write-Output "✅ Container App running successfully"
Write-Output "✅ Application Insights configured"
Write-Output "✅ SQL Database operational"
Write-Output "✅ Storage accounts functional"
Write-Output "✅ All requirements (security + monitoring) satisfied"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "TERRAFORM FILE ANALYSIS:"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "Found: infra/main.tf"
Write-Output "Content: Basic App Service Plan + App Service (outdated)"
Write-Output "Current Usage: NOT BEING USED"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Issues with existing Terraform:"
Write-Output "- Defines App Service Plan (you're using Container Apps now)"
Write-Output "- Missing Container Apps configuration"
Write-Output "- Missing Application Insights"
Write-Output "- Missing Container Registry"
Write-Output "- Location mismatch (East US vs Central India)"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "IS TERRAFORM NECESSARY FOR YOUR PROJECT?"
Write-Output "========================================"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "SHORT ANSWER: NO, NOT NECESSARY"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "REASONS WHY TERRAFORM IS NOT REQUIRED:"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "1. ✅ INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY EXISTS"
Write-Output "   - All Azure resources are deployed and working"
Write-Output "   - Container Apps, databases, storage all functional"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "2. ✅ PROJECT REQUIREMENTS SATISFIED"
Write-Output "   - Security scanning: ✅ Implemented (CodeQL + OWASP)"
Write-Output "   - Monitoring: ✅ Implemented (Application Insights)"
Write-Output "   - Both requirements working without Terraform"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "3. ✅ DEPLOYMENT WORKS VIA AZURE CLI"
Write-Output "   - Azure Pipeline deploys successfully"
Write-Output "   - Container updates work via az containerapp commands"
Write-Output "   - No infrastructure changes needed"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "4. ✅ COST EFFICIENCY"
Write-Output "   - Current setup uses free tiers effectively"
Write-Output "   - ₹8544 credits lasting months"
Write-Output "   - Adding Terraform adds complexity without cost benefit"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "WHEN WOULD TERRAFORM BE USEFUL?"
Write-Output "========================================"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Terraform would be beneficial if:"
Write-Output "- ❌ You need to recreate infrastructure frequently"
Write-Output "- ❌ You have multiple environments (dev/staging/prod)"
Write-Output "- ❌ You need infrastructure version control"
Write-Output "- ❌ You have complex resource dependencies"
Write-Output "- ❌ You're starting from scratch"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Your situation:"
Write-Output "- ✅ Single environment (production)"
Write-Output "- ✅ Infrastructure is stable and working"
Write-Output "- ✅ Focus is on application features, not infrastructure"
Write-Output "- ✅ Project deadline approaching"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "EFFORT VS BENEFIT ANALYSIS:"
Write-Output "========================================"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Adding Terraform now would require:"
Write-Output "- 🕐 2-4 hours to write proper Terraform config"
Write-Output "- 🕐 1-2 hours to import existing resources"
Write-Output "- 🕐 1 hour to test and validate"
Write-Output "- 🕐 Time to handle any migration issues"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Benefits you would get:"
Write-Output "- Infrastructure as Code (good for long-term)"
Write-Output "- Resource recreation capability"
Write-Output "- Infrastructure versioning"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Benefits you already have without Terraform:"
Write-Output "- ✅ Working infrastructure"
Write-Output "- ✅ Automated deployments"
Write-Output "- ✅ Cost optimization"
Write-Output "- ✅ All requirements satisfied"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "RECOMMENDATION:"
Write-Output "========================================"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "FOR YOUR CURRENT PROJECT: SKIP TERRAFORM"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Reasons:"
Write-Output "1. 🎯 Focus on demonstrating working features"
Write-Output "2. 🎯 Both requirements already satisfied"
Write-Output "3. 🎯 Infrastructure is stable and working"
Write-Output "4. 🎯 Time better spent on application polish"
Write-Output "5. 🎯 Cost is already optimized"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "WHAT TO DO INSTEAD:"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "1. ✅ Keep current working setup"
Write-Output "2. ✅ Focus on demonstrating security scanning"
Write-Output "3. ✅ Focus on demonstrating monitoring"
Write-Output "4. ✅ Document current architecture"
Write-Output "5. ✅ Prepare demo scripts (already done)"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "FUTURE CONSIDERATION:"
Write-Output "--------------------------------------"
Write-Output "Add Terraform later if you need to:"
Write-Output "- Create multiple environments"
Write-Output "- Rebuild infrastructure from scratch"
Write-Output "- Add complex resource dependencies"
Write-Output "- Implement infrastructure CI/CD"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "CURRENT TERRAFORM FILE:"
Write-Output "========================================"
Write-Output "Action: Can be ignored or deleted"
Write-Output "Reason: Outdated and not matching current infrastructure"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Your current infrastructure was created via:"
Write-Output "- Azure Portal (manual creation)"
Write-Output "- Azure CLI (automated deployment)"
Write-Output "- Azure Pipelines (CI/CD deployment)"
Write-Output ""

Write-Output "FINAL VERDICT:"
Write-Output "========================================"
Write-Output "🎯 TERRAFORM IS NOT NECESSARY FOR YOUR PROJECT"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "✅ Your infrastructure works perfectly"
Write-Output "✅ Your requirements are satisfied"
Write-Output "✅ Your costs are optimized"
Write-Output "✅ Your deployments are automated"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Focus your energy on:"
Write-Output "- Demonstrating security scanning features"
Write-Output "- Showing monitoring capabilities"
Write-Output "- Polishing application functionality"
Write-Output "- Preparing project presentation"
Write-Output ""
Write-Output "Terraform can be a future enhancement, but it's not needed now!"
