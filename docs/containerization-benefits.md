# Why Containerize the Placement Tracker Application?

- **Consistency**: Works the same on developer laptops, staging, and production.
- **Portability**: Can run on any cloud provider or local machine without environment issues.
- **Faster CI/CD**: Build once â†’ deploy anywhere.
- **Isolation**: Each service runs in its own container, avoiding conflicts.
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale horizontally with Kubernetes or Docker Compose.

In our project, we containerized the backend (`internship-api`) and can containerize the frontend similarly if needed.
